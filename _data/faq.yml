- question: "What is your business model?"
  answer: >
    [Check out](https://safing.io/our-values/#ethical-funding) how we _business_ and where our money comes from.

- question: "Where is the specification?"
  answer: >
    This site ([docs.safing.io](https://docs.safing.io)) describes how Safing works and is the authoritative documentation/specification - if the source code deviates, it's a bug. We do not go into very fine technical detail here because we do not want to replicate information already provided by the great [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/safing/portmaster) tool. We will refer to documentation within GoDoc where appropriate.
