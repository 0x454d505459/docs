This page gives an overview over the current status of supporting mobile platforms.

**⚠️ The Portmaster is currently not available for any mobile platforms.**

While we know supporting mobile will come with a multitude of challenges, it still remains our dream to support many mobile platforms in the future. Currently, these tasks [remain in our backlog](https://safing.io/backlog/).

[You can always see what we are currently working on and what is planned for the near future on the Next Page](https://safing.io/next/).

#### Android

__Technical__

We did a feasibility analysis in 2020 and came to the conclusion that it is feasible to bring the Portmaster to Android.
We did not have time to look at all the details so we do not know yet if every single feature will make it, but it likely the main bulk of features will be portable.

__Distribution__

The Portmaster will put you back in control of your mobile phone and all of its network connections.
We think that this might be against the interests of Google, and the Play store has banned ad blockers in the past.

This means that the Portmaster will likely only be available via alternative app stores, such as F-Droid or via direct `.apk` distributions

#### iOS

__Technical__

We have not yet investigated how to bring the Portmaster to iOS. Looking at the similarities of both Android and iOS, this might be feasible without jailbreak.

We think that this might be against the interests of Apple, and they have banned ad blockers in the past.

As the iOS platform is missing any alternative app stores, without the need of a jailbreak, this may sadly mean that we will not be able to bring the Portmaster to iOS.

#### Linux-Based Phones

With the rise of the [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/) and the [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/), linux-based smartphones are on the brink of entering the broad consumer market.

While we have not yet investigated the situation in detail, we hope to bring the Portmaster to linux-based phones more sooner than later.
