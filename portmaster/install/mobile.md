The Portmaster is currently not available for any mobile platforms.
While this will comes with a multitude of challanges, our dream is to support as many mobile platforms as possible.  

This page gives an overview over the current status of supporting mobile platforms.
If you are interested in what we are currently working on and what is planned for the near future, check out our [next page](https://safing.io/next/).

#### Android

__Technical__

We did a feasibility analysis in 2020 and came to the conclusion that it is feasible to bring the Portmaster to Android.
We did not have time to look at all the details so we don't know yet if every single feature will make it, but we are looking forward a lot to get going.

__Distribution__

The Portmaster puts you back in control.
We think that this might be somewhat against the interests of Google, and the Play store has banned ad blockers in the past.

This means that the Portmaster may only be available via alternative app stores, such as F-Droid.

#### iOS

__Technical__

We have not yet investigated how to bring the Portmaster to iOS. Looking at the similarities of both Android and iOS, this might be feasible without jailbreak.

__Distribution__

The Portmaster puts you back in control.
We think that this might be somewhat against the interests of Apple, and they have banned ad blockers in the past.

As the iOS platform is missing any alternative app stores, without the need of a jailbreak, this may sadly mean that we won't be able to bring the Portmaster to iOS.

In regards to this, also check out a more elaborate explanation on the [status of MacOS](macos).

#### Linux-Based Phones

With the rise of the [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/) and the [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/), linux-based smartphones are on the brink of entering the broad consumer market.

While we have not yet investigated the situation in detail, we hope to bring the Portmaster to linux-based phones more sooner than later.
