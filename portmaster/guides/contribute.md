###### Thanks For Participating!

It is amazing to see you love Portmaster so much that you are checking out this guide. As a small team, **your contribution means the world to us.** We could not do it without you!

## Spread the Word

> With [version 1.0](https://safing.io/blog/2022/10/27/portmaster-reaches-1.0/), Portmaster should be recommended as one of the first steps anybody should take within their privacy journey.

  <p>
    As new software - too few people know about Portmaster. <br/> This is where your impact will be biggest!

### Ask Your Favorite Creators For Reviews

A big help to us would be if you could think of your favorite creators and shows: It could be YouTubers, Newsletters, guides, podcasts and so on. Do these creators know about Portmaster already? Would they enjoy sharing a review on their show? Give them a ping and ask them what they think about Portmaster. This could domino effect into hundreds of thousands of people getting better privacy!

### Do You Have An Audience?

If you are a creator or someone who gives recommendations, no matter what you think of Portmaster - we'd love for you to have a look and tell your audience what you think!

Optionally, give us a ping after to brighten our day.

### Tell Your Friends

We have no idea how you communicate with your friends on- and offline; and we do not want to know. But what we do know is that if you enjoy Portmaster somebody else will likely too. You know best whom to tell and how to tell them. Be it a private signal message or a recommendation on your favorite online forum.

To all of you. Thanks for sharing, it makes all the difference!

## Financial Support

The most direct way to [support Portmaster development]({{ site.pricing_url }}) is through an upgrade. The "Supporter" package gives you optional badges to show off your support, while ["Unlimited"]({{ site.spn_url }}) takes your privacy to the next level.

### Report Bugs, Suggest Features and Improvements

You can easily report bugs as you stumble upon them. It is best if you quickly check other reports to prevent duplicates.

All reports are welcome and help us better understand where the Portmaster experience still needs to improve. While we are not at a stage where we can tackle all incoming issues and edge cases yet, please do note **we read every incoming report**.

If you have any ideas we'd love to hear how you would improve things.

### Contribute to the Code

Overall, we do welcome code contributions - but here are two things you must know before starting:

###### 📑 A Code License Agreement Is Sometimes Required

Our [Code License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/Raphty/e22b3c028c7ec07d995b3882f63d7ebb) gives us full legal flexibility, which we require for our main projects.
The openness of the code is in no way hindered by this: Anyone can still fork and do whatever they want with the code according to its license.
But if you want to change something in our main repositories we do require to keep ownership of the code. This also applies to small fixes or typos.

###### 🗣 For Anything Bigger Communication with Safing Is A Must

We truly do not want you to spend a lot of your precious time and effort into a feature which would turn out to misalign with our current goals and focus. So please, *check with us first via GitHub or <support@safing.io>* before tackling a big pull request.

| ⚔️ Pull Request: Feature Implementation |  📑🗣  | 📑🗣 |  🗣 |

### Assist with Documentation and the Website

{% include github_notification.html %}

#### Report Bugs, Inaccuracies and Typos

We try our best to keep everything running and up-to-date - but you still might find bugs, inaccurate information or typos. In that case, it would be great if you could let us know. Or even create a pull request with a fix.

#### Suggest New Sections

Our Documentation and Website are living projects. We are happy to hear your ideas on what to add or how to improve:

| | Documentation []({{ site.github_docs_url }}) | Website []({{ site.github_web_url }}) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| 🐞 Bug Report | [report]({{ site.github_docs_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) | [report]({{ site.github_web_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) |
| 🐞 Report: Inaccuracy/Typo | [report]({{ site.github_docs_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) | [report]({{ site.github_web_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) |
| 💡 Suggestion: New Page/Segment | [suggest]({{ site.github_docs_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) | [suggest]({{ site.github_web_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) |

#### Contribute to the Web-Projects

We welcome code contributions - still here are two things you must know before starting:

###### 📑 A Code License Agreement Is NOT Required for Docs & Website

Opposed to our [main repositories](#contribute-to-the-code) we do not require full legal flexibility with these repositories. You can simply clone and set up a pull request with no legal jumbo in your way.

###### 🗣 For Anything Bigger Communication with Safing Is A Must

However, we truly do not want you to spend a lot of your precious time and effort into a feature which would turn out to misalign with our current goals and focus. So please, *check with us first via GitHub or <support@safing.io>* before tackling a bigger pull request.

| | Documentation []({{ site.github_docs_url }}) | Website []({{ site.github_web_url }}) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ⚔️ Pull Request: Typos and Small Fixes |  |  |
| ⚔️ Pull Request: Feature Implementation | 🗣 | 🗣 |

### Other, Out-Of-Scope

If you want to contribute beyond the listed guide it is best to check with us first. We as a team have limited resources and do not want your precious time and effort to go to waste. So please, _check with us first via GitHub or <support@safing.io>_.
