###### Thanks For Participating!

Your contributions will have the highest impact when aligned with Safing's current goals and focus. As a result, these are the current scopes where we are super thankful for your participation:

## Use the Portmaster

{% include github_notification.html %}

### Report Bugs, Suggest Features and Improvements

You can easily report bugs as you stumble upon them. It is best if you quickly check other reports to prevent duplicates.
If you have any ideas we'd love to hear how you would improve things.

| | Portmaster []({{ site.github_pm_url }}) | User Interface []({{ site.github_pm_ui_url }}) | Packaging []({{ site.github_pm_packaging_url }}) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 🐞 Bug Report | [report]({{ site.github_pm_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) | [report]({{ site.github_pm_ui_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) | [report]({{ site.github_pm_packaging_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) |
| 💡 Suggestion: New Feature | [suggest]({{ site.github_pm_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) | [suggest]({{ site.github_pm_ui_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) | [suggest]({{ site.github_pm_packaging_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) |

### Report Linux Distribution Compatibility

Help us understand Portmaster compatibility with different Linux distributions. Whether it works with your distro or not - your reports will help us massively to know where we stand. We will update the [Linux compatibility list](../install/linux#compatibility) accordingly.

### Report VPN Compatibility

Help us understand Portmaster compatibility with different VPN clients. Whether the VPN client works together with the Portmaster or not - your reports will help us massively to know where we currently stand. All reports are collected, updated and easily accessible in the [VPN Compatibility section](../install/status/vpn-compatibility).

### Report Software Compatibility

Have certain applications stopped working with the Portmaster? Or games? Or a special development tool? Your reports will help us massively to know where we currently stand. All reports are collected and easily accessible in the [Software Compatibility section](../install/status/software-compatibility).

| 📝 Compatibility Report: VPN | [report]({{ site.github_pm_url }}{{ site.github_report_compatibility_url }}) |
| 📝 Compatibility Report: Linux distro | [report]({{ site.github_pm_url }}{{ site.github_report_compatibility_url }}) |
| 📝 Compatibility Report: General Software | [report]({{ site.github_pm_url }}{{ site.github_report_compatibility_url }}) |

### Contribute to the Code

Overall, we do welcome code contributions - but here are two things you must know before starting:

###### 📑 A Code License Agreement Is Sometimes Required

Our [Code License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/Raphty/e22b3c028c7ec07d995b3882f63d7ebb) gives us full legal flexibility, which we require for our main projects.
The openness of the code is in no way hindered by this: Anyone can still fork and do whatever they want with the code according to its license.
But if you want to change something in our main repositories we do require to keep ownership of the code. This also applies to small fixes or typos.

###### 🗣 For Anything Bigger Communication with Safing Is A Must

We truly do not want you to spend a lot of your precious time and effort into a feature which would turn out to misalign with our current goals and focus. So please, *check with us first via GitHub or <support@safing.io>* before tackling a big pull request.

|   | Portmaster []({{ site.github_pm_url }}) | User Interface []({{ site.github_pm_ui_url }}) | Packaging []({{ site.github_pm_packaging_url }})  |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ⚔️ Pull Request: Typos and Small Fixes | 📑 | 📑 |  |
| ⚔️ Pull Request: Feature Implementation |  📑🗣  | 📑🗣 |  🗣 |

## Spread the Word

### Tell Your Friends

We have no idea how you communicate with your friends; and we do not want to know. But what we do know is that we would not be here without so many of you telling your friends about Safing and Portmaster. Thanks for doing this - it makes all the difference.

### Tell the Internet

You can even spread the word wherever you realm in the Internet. Share Portmaster in a forum. Recommend Portmaster being added to a cool list or website. Or just share a blog article you enjoyed on reddit, lobsters, etc. Thanks for sharing!

## Assist with Documentation and the Website

{% include github_notification.html %}

### Report Bugs, Inaccuracies and Typos

We try our best to keep everything running and up-to-date - but you still might find bugs, inaccurate information or typos. In that case, it would be great if you could let us know. Or even create a pull request with a fix.

### Suggest New Sections

Our Documentation and Website are living projects. We are happy to hear your ideas on what to add or how to improve:

| | Documentation []({{ site.github_docs_url }}) | Website []({{ site.github_web_url }}) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| 🐞 Bug Report | [report]({{ site.github_docs_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) | [report]({{ site.github_web_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) |
| 🐞 Report: Inaccuracy/Typo | [report]({{ site.github_docs_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) | [report]({{ site.github_web_url }}{{ site.github_report_bug_url }}) |
| 💡 Suggestion: New Page/Segment | [suggest]({{ site.github_docs_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) | [suggest]({{ site.github_web_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) |
| 💡 Suggestion: Improvements | [suggest]({{ site.github_docs_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) | [suggest]({{ site.github_web_url }}{{ site.github_suggest_feature_url }}) |

### Contribute to the Web-Projects

We welcome code contributions - still here are two things you must know before starting:

###### 📑 A Code License Agreement Is NOT Required for Docs & Website

Opposed to our [main repositories](#contribute-to-the-code) we do not require full legal flexibility with these repositories. You can simply clone and set up a pull request with no legal jumbo in your way.

###### 🗣 For Anything Bigger Communication with Safing Is A Must

However, we truly do not want you to spend a lot of your precious time and effort into a feature which would turn out to misalign with our current goals and focus. So please, *check with us first via GitHub or <support@safing.io>* before tackling a bigger pull request.

| | Documentation []({{ site.github_docs_url }}) | Website []({{ site.github_web_url }}) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ⚔️ Pull Request: Typos and Small Fixes |  |  |
| ⚔️ Pull Request: Feature Implementation | 🗣 | 🗣 |

## Other, Out-Of-Scope

If you want to contribute beyond the listed guide it is best to check with us first. We as a team have limited resources and do not want your precious time and effort to go to waste. So please, _check with us first via GitHub or <support@safing.io>_.
